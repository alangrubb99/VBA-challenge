Challenge2 -  Stock Market VBA

I Originally deveoped using alphabetical_testing.xlsm.  My code is a Macro called StockYears.
It Loops thru Sheets A through F using ws.Cells to address the cell data in Each Sheet.

I moved StockYears Macro to Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm and modifed the code by using 
ws.Activate.  I changed all ws.Cells to Cells in this version.  It Loops
through Sheets for 2018, 2019 and 2020.
I was unable to upload Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm file to this repo because it was too large.

Copied and pasted Macro from .xlsm file to .vbs file and uploaded to repo
